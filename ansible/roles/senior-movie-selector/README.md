# General

With this role you can install the [senior-movie-selector](https://github.com/JohannesFleischer/senior-movie-selector) project on a raspberry pi with the raspbian 64-bit OS

Besides the installation there is also a autostart functionality added that automatically restarts the application on startup and starts chromium in fullscreen with the client opened.

## Supported Platforms

tested on and written for raspbian 64bit
the installation probably works also on other Debian based operating systems but the autostart on boot wont work
