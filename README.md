# Senior Movie Selector

## Start

## Production

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

> **Notes:**
>
> - if you want to use the application after reboots you should restart it with `docker compose restart`
> - to run it on a raspi see [here](#additional)

## Developement

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up -d
```

> **Note:** if you want to edit a react service i recommend to start this service first (e.g. with `nodemon`) and then launch the other services with `docker compose` so you don't have to rebuild all services every time

## Services

### for users

- [db_client](http://localhost:8000) to insert or edit Movies in the DB
- [client](http://localhost) to select and watch movies

### for nerds

- [db_server](http://localhost:3000) with the db-api for the actual mongo-db
- [fileserver](http://localhost:1337) that serves as a file server for the other services and hosts the videoplayer.
- [mongodb](http://localhost:27017) actual db that stores the data in the `mongo` folder

## Setup

1. copy movie files in `videoplayer/films` and the film-posters in `videoplayer/poster` or replace the folders with symlinks and then restart with `docker compose restart`.
2. create db entries for all films with the db_client
3. profit

## Usage

### Client

The main application is the `client`.
The Client selects `movie_count` files that are displayed on the Screen.
Supported actions are:

- `Hover` over a movie -> shows description
- `Click` on a movie -> starts the videoplayer with the filename from the db
- `Escape`/`Backspace`/ `ArrowUp` -> reload
- `ArrowRight`/ `ArrowLeft` -> select movies
- `Enter` -> start selected movie

### Fileserver

The second user application is the `fileserver`.
In general this address has not to be opened manually. If you want to do so see [Services](#services).
The file server hosts all film and poster files but also fonts and the static videoplayer file:

#### Videoplayer

The videoplayer (main.html) takes an filename as a url parameter and tries to open that file.
When clicking on a film in the `client` you get redirected to the videoplayer. The player then tries to open the videofile with the name from the db.
If the file is not found or if an error occurs you get redirected back to the `client`.
If the videofile is found the videoplayer tries to start it automatically in \"fullscreen\" (technically just laaarge)

> **Notes:**
>
> - to start the video automatically in Firefox this has to be allowed manually at least once
> - Supported filetypes are [depending on your browser](https://videojs.com/guides/faqs/#q-what-media-formats-does-videojs-support). Mp4 should work on all common browsers.

Supported actions are:

- `Click`/`Enter` -> start/stop
- `Backspace` -> return to `client`
- `ArrowRight`/`ArrowLeft` -> Â±15 seconds (can be hold for longer periods)

### Information about hosting on a pi

To run on a raspberry pi use either the [64-bit version](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/#raspberry-pi-os-64-bit) on `raspi 3+`</br>
or [ubuntu for raspberry pi](https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi) on `raspi 4+`


### Information about remote easyfications

 Through the supported key-events a remote like [this one](https://www.amazon.de/Andoer%C2%AE-Magische-Drahtlose-Fernbedienung-PC-Projektor-Type-1/dp/B015SO37SY) can be used
To make it even easier to use with an remote you can [disable](https://superuser.com/questions/775785/how-to-disable-a-keyboard-key-in-linux-ubuntu) all Buttons you don't need. **But beware: this settings are system-wide**

### Information about updating the database externally

The project itself runs completely locally, but if the target computer is connected to the internet, it is also possible to update the database from another computer using ssh port forwarding. This can be done on Linux for example with this command `ssh -L 3000:127.0.0.1:3000 <user>@<ip-of-your-pie>` or alternatively with this entry in your `~/.ssh/config`

```sh
Host pi-db-fwd
	HostName <ip-of-your-pie>
	User <user>
	LocalForward 3000 127.0.0.1:3000
```

and the corresponding command `ssh pi-db-fwd`.
After that the `db-client` can be started on your computer and it will automatically access the database of your pie. The whole thing also works over a VPN connection.
